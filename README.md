# COVID-19-Predictive-Modelling.
Predictive modeling and analysis of COVID-19 trends using machine learning and time-series analysis
The project focuses on building a predictive system to forecast COVID-19 trends and provide actionable insights for public health decision-making. Using historical COVID-19 data, key steps included data cleaning,  feature engineering, and predictive modeling. 
The dataset contained information such as daily new cases, deaths, and locations, which were enriched with derived features 
like cumulative confirmed cases and mortality rates
